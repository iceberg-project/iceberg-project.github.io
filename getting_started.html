			The ICEBERG project is focused on helping domain scientists make the most of high resolution satellite imagery. 
			Most domain scientists don't have a lot of experience using high-performance computers or remote clusters, 
			so here we offer a basic getting started guide. If you are already familiar with running software on a 
			high-performance cluster or are a software developer interested in extending the ICEBERG tools for new 
			applications, this guide is not for you and you should go 
			<a href="https://github.com/iceberg-project/ICEBERG-administration/wiki/Development-Guide-Documentation">here</a> instead.
			<br /><br />
			All of the projects developed by the ICEBERG team to date involve the classification of features or 
			the detection of specific objects in high-resolution imagery. Our land cover classification project 
			involves the classification of geological features based on the reflectance properties of individual pixels, 
			whereas
			the other projects involve the use of computer vision models that take into account features at larger 
			spatial scales as well. Either way, the goal is to take satellite imagery and extract useful information 
			from it in an automated fashion that is easily scaled-up to cover very large areas of interest 
			(far beyond what one could do without the aid of computers).
			<br /><br />
			We've developed a set of models designed for specific science applications (finding penguins or 
			seals or rivers, for example) as well as a more general set of tools that help deploy these models 
			efficiently on a remote computing cluster, the latter of which we will refer to as "middleware".
			<br /><br />
			To get you started, we'll walk through an explanation as to how to run the models we've developed 
			on your own computer (assuming you have the system requirements, see below) and then we'll walk you 
			through the documentation for running this on a remote cluster.

			<h3>System requirements to run ICEBERG tools on your local desktop/laptop computer</h3>
			Systems such as XSEDE Bridges are recommended, but other resources, such as a local cluster, desktop, or laptop, 
			can be used if cuda, python3, and a NVIDIA P100 GPU are present.  Start-up allocations are readily available 
			on XSEDE, apply <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup">here</a><br /><br />
            Minimum system requirements for running the LandCover tools:<br />
                        <br />
			Python 3 <br />
			<br />
			Minimum system requirements for running all the other ICEBERG models:<br />
                        <br />
			Python 3 <br />
			CPU and GPU (tested with NVIDIA P100) + CUDA CuDNN <br />
			<br />
			All other dependancies will be installed with the software links below.
			<ul>
			  <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/iceberg-penguins.search/">Penguins</a></li>
			  <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/iceberg-seals.search/">Seals</a></li>
			  <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/iceberg-rivers.search/">Rivers</a></li>
			  <li>LandCover - coming in fall 2020.</li>
		        </ul>
		</div>
		<hr/>
		<div>
			<h3>Setup and installation</h3>
			<p>These instructions are specific to XSEDE Bridges but other resources can be used if cuda, python3, gdal (Rivers only)
			and a NVIDIA P100 GPU are present (the LandCover project requires only python3), in which case 'module load' instructions 
			can be skipped, which are specific to Bridges.
			<br /><br />
			<u>For Unix or Mac Users:</u>
                        Login to bridges via ssh using a Unix or Mac command line terminal. Login is available to bridges directly or through 
			the XSEDE portal. Please see the <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/psc-bridges">Bridges User's Guide</a>.
			<br /><br />
			<u>For Windows Users:</u>
                        Many tools are available for ssh access to bridges. Please see Ubuntu, MobaXterm or PuTTY
			<br /><br />
			The lines below following a '$' are commands to enter (or cut and paste) into your terminal (note that all commands are 
			case-sensitive, meaning capital and lowercase letters are differentiated.) Everything following '#' are comments to 
			explain the reason for the command and should not be included in what you enter. Lines that do not start with '$' 
			or '[my_env] $' are output you should expect to see.

			<h3>Getting ready for processing</h3>
			  <h4>These instructions apply to bridges and may not apply if you are using other resources.</h4>
			  You will start a new session using the ssh steps above, then execute the following commands:
			<pre>
                          <code>
$ interact -p GPU-small --gres=gpu:p100:1 -t 00:30:00 # request a compute node for 30 minutes.  This package has been tested on P100 GPUs on bridges, 
                                             but that does not exclude any other resource that offers the same GPUs. 
					     (this may take a minute or two or more to receive an allocation).
					     Click <a href="https://www.psc.edu/bridges/user-guide/running-jobs#interact" target=_blank>here</a> for more details on the interact command.  
					     For a single node, 30 minutes per image is recommended.
$ cd $SCRATCH                      # switch to your working space.
$ cd ICEBERG                       # move into your environment directory.
$ module load cuda                 # load parallel computing architecture (this is not needed for the LandCover pipeline).
$ module load python3              # load correct python version.
$ module load gdal/2.2.1           # load gdal (for the Rivers pipeline only, it is not needed for the other pipelines).
$ source my_env/bin/activate    # activate the environment you created earlier. Notice the command line prompt changes to show your environment on the next line.
[my_env] $ pwd
/pylon5/group/username/ICEBERG
[my_env] $ export PYTHONPATH=<path>/my_env/lib/python3.5/site-packages # set a system variable to point python to your specific code. (Replace <path> with the results of pwd command above).
[my_env] $ mkdir ICEBERG_run    # this can be called anything you like that describes your work.  It is where your input imagery is located and where output will be written.
[my_env] $ cd ICEBERG_run
                          </code>
                        </pre>
			You are now ready to process imagery with the instructions below!
		</div>
		<hr/>
		<div>
			<h3>Single image processing</h3>
			  <h4>Penguins</h4>
			  Coming soon
			  <br \> <br \>
                            
			  <h4>Seals</h4>
			  - Download the <a href="https://github.com/iceberg-project/Seals/tree/master/models/Heatmap-Cnt/UnetCntWRN/UnetCntWRN_ts-vanilla.tar">
				  pre-trained model</a>.  Experienced users can also train their own model.  Code is provided in the 
			  <a href="https://github.com/iceberg-project/Seals">Seals GitHub Repository</a>, no packaged version is offered.
			  <br \> <br \>

			  Seals predicting is executed in two steps: <br />
1) Create tiles from an input GeoTiff image and write to the output_folder. The scale_bands parameter (in pixels) depends on the trained model being used.  
The default scale_bands is 224 for the pre-trained model downloaded above.  If you use your own model the scale_bands may be different.<br />
From the command line and virtual environment used for the installation steps above, the tiling command is:
			<pre>
                          <code>
[iceberg_seals] $ iceberg_seals.tiling --scale_bands=224 --input_image=<image_abspath> --output_folder=./test
                          </code>
                        </pre>
			<i>Where image_abspath is the path to the imagery you want to process.</i><br /><br />

2) Detect seals on each tile and output counts and confidence for each tile.
			<pre>
                          <code>
[iceberg_seals] $ iceberg_seals.predicting --input_image=<image_filename> --model_architecture=UnetCntWRN --hyperparameter_set=A --training_set=test_vanilla --test_folder=./test --model_path=./ --output_folder=./test_image
                          </code>
                        </pre>
			  <h4>Rivers</h4>
			  - Download a pre-trained model at: Pending - a default model will be released in Oct 2020<br />

                          You can download to your local machine and use scp, ftp, rsync, or Globus to [transfer to bridges](https://portal.xsede.org/psc-bridges).

			  <br \> <br \>
			  Rivers predicting is executed in three steps: <br />
			  1) Create tiles from an input GeoTiff image and write to the output_folder. The scale_bands parameter (in pixels) depends on the trained model being used.  The default scale_bands is 224 for the pre-trained model downloaded above.  If you use your own model the scale_bands may be different.<br />
From the command line and virtual environment used for the installation steps above, the tiling command is:
			<pre>
                          <code>
[iceberg_rivers] $ iceberg_rivers.tiling --scale_bands=224 --input_image=image_abspath --output_folder=./test
                          </code>
                        </pre>
			2) Then, detect rivers on each tile and output counts and confidence for each tile.
			<pre>
                          <code>
[iceberg_rivers] $ iceberg_rivers.predicting --input_image=image_filename --model_architecture=UnetCntWRN --hyperparameter_set=A --training_set=test_vanilla --test_folder=./test --model_path=./ --output_folder=./test_image
                          </code>
                        </pre>
                        3) Finally, mosaic all the tiles back into one image.
			<pre>
                          <code>
[iceberg_rivers] $ iceberg_rivers.mosaic --input_WV image --input masks_folder --tile_size 224 --step 112 --output_folder ./mosaic
                          </code>
                        </pre>
			<i>Where 'image' is the original input image and 'mask_folder' is the folder containing the predicting output.</i><br />
			  <br \> <br \>

			  <h4>LandCover</h4>
			  - There is a pre-processed library of landcover classification shapefiles: Pending - a default library will be released in late 2020<br />
			  - Here is the map of regions available: Pending - the pre-processed map will be released in late 2020<br />

			  <br \>
			  If you have your own imagery to process and classify, LandCover is executed in five steps: (available in late 2020)<br />
			  1) Perform top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance calibration on raw digital number (DN) imagery.<br />
From the command line and virtual environment used for the installation steps above, the TOA command is:
			<pre>
                          <code>
[iceberg_rivers] $ iceberg_landcover.rad -ip Data
                          </code>
                        </pre>
			<i>Where Data is the path to the input imagery.</i><br />
			  <br \> <br \>
			2) Perform atmospheric corrections on the TOA imagery.
			<pre>
                          <code>
[iceberg_rivers] $ iceberg_landcover.atmcorr -ip Data
                          </code>
                        </pre>
			3) Perform surface reflectance calibration on the atmosphere correctioned imagery.
			<pre>
                          <code>
[iceberg_rivers] $ iceberg_landcover.refl -ip Data
                          </code>
                        </pre>
			4) Use the surface reflectance imagery to create a classification map
			<pre>
                          <code>
[iceberg_rivers] $ iceberg_landcover.classify -ip Data
                          </code>
                        </pre>
			5) Finally, create shapefiles from the classification map.
			<pre>
                          <code>
[iceberg_rivers] $ iceberg_landcover.shapefiles -ip Data
                          </code>
                        </pre>
