			The ICEBERG project is focused on helping domain scientists make the most of high resolution satellite imagery. 
			Most domain scientists don't have a lot of experience using high-performance computers or remote clusters, 
			so here we offer a basic getting started guide. If you are already familiar with running software on a 
			high-performance cluster or are a software developer interested in extending the ICEBERG tools for new 
			applications, this guide is not for you and you should go 
			<a href="https://github.com/iceberg-project/ICEBERG-administration/wiki/Development-Guide-Documentation">here</a> instead.
			<br /><br />
			All of the projects developed by the ICEBERG team to date involve the classification of features or 
			the detection of specific objects in high-resolution imagery. Our land cover classification project 
			involves the classification of geological features based on the reflectance properties of individual pixels, 
			whereas
			the other projects involve the use of computer vision models that take into account features at larger 
			spatial scales as well. Either way, the goal is to take satellite imagery and extract useful information 
			from it in an automated fashion that is easily scaled-up to cover very large areas of interest 
			(far beyond what one could do without the aid of computers).
			<br /><br />
			We've developed a set of models designed for specific science applications (finding penguins or 
			seals or rivers, for example) as well as a more general set of tools that help deploy these models 
			efficiently on a remote computing cluster, the latter of which we will refer to as "middleware".
			<br /><br />
			To get you started, we'll walk through an explanation as to how to run the models we've developed 
			on your own computer (assuming you have the system requirements, see below) and then we'll walk you 
			through the documentation for running this on a remote cluster.

			<h3>System requirements and installation to run ICEBERG tools on your local desktop/laptop computer</h3>
			Systems such as XSEDE Bridges are recommended, but other resources, such as a local cluster, desktop, or laptop, 
			can be used if cuda, python3, and a NVIDIA P100 GPU are present.  Start-up allocations are readily available 
			on XSEDE, apply <a href="https://portal.xsede.org/allocations/startup">here</a><br /><br />
            Minimum system requirements for running the LandCover tools:<br />
                        <br />
			Python 3 <br />
			One or more CPUs<br />
			<br />
			Minimum system requirements for running all the other ICEBERG models:<br />
                        <br />
			Linux <br />
			Python 3 <br />
			CPU and NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN <br />
			<br />
			All other dependancies will be installed with the software links below.
