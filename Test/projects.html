			<p>There are four major use cases that we will be developing initially for ICEBERG. More detailed information and code may be found at our <a href="https://github.com/iceberg-project" target="_blank">github site</a>.</p>
	<br\><br\>		ASIFT (Polar glaciology and geomorphology using 4D change detection)<br\><br\>
ASIFT will provide the functionality for the user to take an airborne or satellite image anywhere that we have Worldview Ortho-rectified imagery available, and where the user knows the approximate location of the photo (within ~100 km) but does not have geo-location information on it. The ASIFT Workflow be able to pin down where that photo was taken, automatically determine a likely set of geo-located ground control points for the image, and ortho-rectify the image if needed. 
<br\><br\>
Rivers (Arctic hydrology)<br\><br\>
We provide a classification algorithm for ice surface features from high-resolution imagery.  This algorithm was developed by convolutional neural network training to detect regions of large and small rivers and to distinguish them from crevasses and non-channelized slush. We also provide a detection algorithm to extract polyline water features from the classified high-probability river areas.
<br\><br\>
Seals/Penguins (Biological feature detection)
Antarctic pack-ice seals, a group of four species of true seals (Phocidae), play a pivotal role in the Southern Ocean foodweb as wide-ranging Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) predators. This project aims to automate pack-ice seal surveys using a combination of remote sensing, computer vision, seal ecology and HPC. Apart from being cheaper and safer when compared to aerial imagery, the scale at which we can survey pack-ice seals with remote sensing imagery will fill an important information gap in Antarctic ecology. This study also showcases the ever-growing benefits of incorporating AI into ecological sampling designs.
We provide a detection algorithm to extract the location of seals from high-resolution
imagery. This algorithm was developed by convolutional neural network training to
detect and count seal haul-outs. This is beneficial, as a comprehensive pack-ice
seal census and monitoring will provide key information on the health and evolution
of the Southern Ocean ecosystem.
<br\><br\>
We provide a detection algorithm to extract the location of penguin colonies from high-resolution
imagery. This algorithm was developed by convolutional neural network training to
detect the extent of guano patches indicating penguin colonies. This is beneficial, as a penguin colony census and monitoring will provide key information on the health and evolution
of the Antarctic ecosystem.

<br\><br\>
LandCover (Geological land cover classification)
			<br\>
			LandCover is a pipeline for automated processing of satellite imagery, automated
detection and removal of snow, ice, water, and shadows from the scene, automated
atmospheric characterization and removal, and automated â€œstretching'' of the
scenes to provide spatial coverage of surveyed area, reasonable estimates on
atmospheric contributions, and comparisons to a spectral library of known geologic
materials.
