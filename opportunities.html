We are currently recruiting two Ph.D. positions associated with ICEBERG, and two research programmer positions. Descriptions of each position are below. Prospective students, post-docs, and research programmers with an interest in combining satellite imagery and high performance computing should contact ICEBERG PI Heather Lynch (heather.lynch@stonybrook.edu) for more information.

**Northern Arizona University**

Dr. Mark Salvatore is seeking applications for a PhD student to start in the Fall of 2018.  The student will work with high-resolution multispectral satellite data to identify, characterize, and map geologic units throughout the ice-free regions of Antarctica.  As part of a large collaborative and federally funded project, the student will also work closely with researchers, computer programmers, and students at collaborating institutions.  A successful candidate will have a strong background in surface geology, remote sensing, geographic information systems, and/or geologic mapping.  Prior research experience and computer programming skills are preferred.
The student will become a member of the dynamic and evolving Department of Physics & Astronomy at Northern Arizona University.  With a growing emphasis on planetary sciences, students in this program develop a deep understanding of planetary formation and evolution, remote sensing, spectroscopy, and planetary surface processes.  PhD students benefit from a full tuition waiver, a competitive stipend, and have the opportunity to participate in the campus healthcare plan.  Northern Arizona University is located in beautiful Flagstaff, Arizona, a four-season town located at the base of the San Francisco peaks and 70 miles from the Grand Canyon.  The Department of Physics & Astronomy is home to a friendly, engaging, and welcoming environment for individuals of all races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, and world views.
Applications are due by December 15, 2017.  Interested students should contact Dr. Salvatore directly (mark.salvatore@nau.edu) prior to submitting an application.

**University of California, Santa Barbara**

The Cryo-Hydrologic Remote Sensing Lab in the Department of Geography at the University of California - Santa Barbara is seeking prospective PhD students to start in 2018. The funded project aims to understand water balance in Arctic glacial systems through integration of DEMs and imagery-enabled classification of hydrological features.
Candidates with a background in remote sensing, GIS, or earth science, and strong programming skills (e.g. in IDL, Python, Matlab) are encouraged to apply.

Applicants should contact Prof. Vena Chu (venachu@ucsb.edu) with a CV/resume and a statement of research interests. For more information about the Graduate Program in Geography at UCSB, see the Geography Graduate Program Description (application deadline is December 15th).

**Stony Brook University**

The applicant will be responsible for prototyping and delivering production grade cyberinfrastructure for polar imagery processing workflows in high-performance and distributed computing. This includes imagery applications, libraries and workflow toolkits. Knowledge of Image analysis, GIS and Remote Sensing concepts is helpful but not mandatory. 

Primary responsibilities include but are not limited to:

* Develop tools and software frameworks that can effectively utilize high-performance and distributed computing (including cloud infrastructure)
*   Collaborate with application/domain scientist to derive requirements and implement solutions
*   Program in Python/C and related languages
*   Deliver tested, documented and production grade software 
*   Image Analysis Algorithms and Methods, including Machine-Learning techniques.

A successful programmer will be expected to deliver working prototypes and write technical reports. Will be familiar with modern software engineering methodology and scientific computing. 

The applicant must possess strong problem-solving skills, must have good organizational and communication skills and be able to work under minimal supervision. 

Will have either a MS/BS in Computer Science/Engineering with 3-5 years post-degree experience, or a PhD in Computer Science/Engineering or closely related discipline.

Will be based at Stony Brook University.

Please contact either Heather Lynch (heather.lynch@stonybrook.edu) or Shantenu Jha (shantenu.jha@stonybrook.edu).
