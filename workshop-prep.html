In preparation and to save time during the event we have two homework assignments:<br>
1) If you not familiar with Linux or the command shell please review the following two links:<br>
<a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/</a> (at least sections 1-3)<br>
and<br>
<a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/">http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-extras/</a><br>
We will be using the Linux command line from the beginning and everything else builds off of it.<br>
If you do not have access to Linux, Windows users can try https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/ubuntu/9nblggh4msv6.  Mac users can use the built-in terminal.<br>
<br>
Also, if you are not familiar with version control or GitHub please see:<br>
<a href="http://shinstitute.org/webinar-series/2019-intro-to-git/">http://shinstitute.org/webinar-series/2019-intro-to-git/</a><br>
This is a recording of a webinar given earlier this year, so you will not be able to do all of the exercises, but it provides a nice start.  The video says it runs 1:08, but the main presentation is only about 50 minutes.<br>
<br>
2) You are invited to prepare up to about 5 slides to present your research or propose use cases to start a discussion on how ICEBERG might help.  This session will be held late morning on Tuesday.
